# PHR: Implement Phase 2 Tasks for RAG Validation System

## Prompt

implement the remaining tasks of phase 2, of 1-rag-validation-testing if any task work has already done but not marked as done, then don't repeat it

## Response

Successfully implemented all remaining Phase 2 tasks for the RAG validation and testing feature:

1. Created validation report generator in backend/rag_validation/validation_report.py
2. Created time measurement utilities in backend/rag_validation/performance_utils.py

All Phase 2 tasks (T006-T012) have been completed and marked as [X] in the tasks.md file. The foundational components for the RAG validation system are now in place, including configuration loading, structured logging, test data generation, error handling, validation reporting, and performance measurement utilities.
