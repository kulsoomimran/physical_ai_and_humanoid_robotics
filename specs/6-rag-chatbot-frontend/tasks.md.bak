# Tasks: Frontend Integration for RAG Chatbot

**Feature**: Frontend Integration for RAG Chatbot
**Branch**: 6-rag-chatbot-frontend
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Feature specification and plan from `/specs/6-rag-chatbot-frontend/`

## Implementation Strategy

MVP approach: Start with core functionality (User Story 1), then add loading states and errors (User Story 2), followed by response formatting and streaming (User Story 3). Each user story should be independently testable.

## Dependencies

User stories have minimal dependencies and can be developed independently, though Story 2 (loading states) should be implemented with Story 1 in mind.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Component development and API integration can be developed in parallel
- UI styling and component logic can be developed in parallel
- Custom hooks can be developed in parallel with the main component

---

## Phase 1: Setup

### Goal
Initialize the project structure and development environment for the RAG chatbot integration.

- [ ] T001 Set up project structure with Chatbot component directory in content/src/components/Chatbot/
- [ ] T002 [P] Create initial Chatbot.jsx file with React component skeleton
- [ ] T003 [P] Create Chatbot.css file for component styling
- [ ] T004 [P] Create hooks/useChatAPI.js file for API communication logic
- [ ] T005 Configure environment variables for backend URL in .env file

## Phase 2: Foundational Components

### Goal
Implement core components and utilities that support all user stories.

- [ ] T006 Implement useChatAPI custom hook with fetch function for POST /chat endpoint
- [ ] T007 [P] Add API configuration options (timeout, retry attempts) to useChatAPI hook
- [ ] T008 [P] Implement selected text capture functionality using window.getSelection()
- [ ] T009 Create ChatMessage component for displaying individual messages in content/src/components/Chatbot/ChatMessage.jsx
- [ ] T010 [P] Define message types based on data model (UserQuestion, ChatResponse)

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Embed Chat UI in Docusaurus Pages (Priority: P1)

### Goal
Integrate a basic chat UI component within Docusaurus book pages that allows users to ask questions and receive responses.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by embedding a basic chat interface on a book page and verifying that users can type questions and receive responses from the backend.

- [ ] T011 [US1] Implement main Chatbot component UI with input field and message display area
- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Add functionality to send user questions to the backend `/chat` endpoint
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Implement display of responses from the backend in the chat interface
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Add support for including selected text as context in user questions
- [ ] T015 [US1] Integrate Chatbot component into Docusaurus layout via docusaurus.config.js
- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Test basic question/response flow with backend API

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Handle Loading States and Errors (Priority: P2)

### Goal
Implement clear loading indicators and error messages to provide feedback during API interactions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating API calls and verifying that appropriate loading states and error messages are displayed.

- [ ] T017 [US2] Add loading state management to Chatbot component based on ChatUIState model
- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Implement visual loading indicator during API communication
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Add error state management to display appropriate messages when API calls fail
- [ ] T020 [US2] Implement error handling for network failures and backend errors
- [ ] T021 [P] [US2] Add timeout handling for API requests
- [ ] T022 [US2] Test error scenarios and loading states with simulated API responses

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Support Response Streaming and Formatting (Priority: P3)

### Goal
Format responses properly and implement streaming support for a smooth conversational experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending questions that generate multi-line or longer responses and verifying proper formatting and streaming behavior.

- [ ] T023 [US3] Implement response formatting for multi-line answers based on FR-007
- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Add markdown support for rich text formatting in responses
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Implement streaming response support if backend provides streaming capability
- [ ] T026 [US3] Add source document display for responses that include references
- [ ] T027 [P] [US3] Optimize component performance to ensure lightweight implementation (FR-008)
- [ ] T028 [US3] Test response formatting and streaming behavior with various response types

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Goal
Finalize the implementation with cross-cutting concerns and optimizations.

- [ ] T029 Add responsive design to ensure chat UI works on all screen sizes
- [ ] T030 [P] Implement accessibility features for the chat interface
- [ ] T031 Add keyboard navigation and shortcuts for the chat component
- [ ] T032 Optimize bundle size to minimize impact on page load times (FR-008, SC-005)
- [ ] T033 [P] Add local storage for preserving chat history between page visits
- [ ] T034 Test integration across multiple book pages to ensure consistent behavior
- [ ] T035 Update documentation with usage instructions and configuration options
