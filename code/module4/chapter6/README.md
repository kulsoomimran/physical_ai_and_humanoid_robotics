# Chapter 24: Advanced VLA Applications and Integration - Code Examples

This directory contains example code for Chapter 24: Advanced VLA Applications and Integration.

## Examples

### Advanced VLA Integration Demo
Demonstrates advanced VLA applications and integration concepts:
- `advanced_vla_integration.py`: Python implementation showing complete VLA pipeline integration, real-time processing, system-level optimization, multi-robot coordination, advanced perception-action loops, and performance optimization techniques

## Running the Examples

### Advanced VLA Integration Demo

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+, numpy, and opencv-python installed:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
```
